Usage : ./nanotekspice [Configuration File] [input_name]=[value]
	NanoTekSpice is a logic simulator that builds a graph
	(the nodes of which will be simulated digital electronic components, inputs or outputs)
	from a configuration file, and injects values into that graph to get results.

Configuration File:
	The first part, starting with the '.chipsets:' statement is used to declare and name
	components that will be used by the program.
	Some components may need to be initialized with a value,
	which is provided after the name, between parenthesis.
	The second part, starting with the '.links:' statement
	is used to declare links between components.
	Each link indicates which pin of which component are linked.
